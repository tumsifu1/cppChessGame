This project is a basic chess application developed as a personal exercise in creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and working with databases. While the app is not fully functional as a chess engine, it focuses on:

Building a custom GUI for visualizing and interacting with a chessboard.

Creating a personal puzzle trainer by utilizing the Lichess chess puzzle database.

Initially, the goal was to link the app to a Chess.com account and allow users to practice their most challenging puzzles. However, the focus shifted to designing a GUI and implementing database functionality for puzzle training.
